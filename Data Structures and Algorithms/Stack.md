# Stack

1. why is Stack a class while Queue is a Interface: one reason is that there are variants of Queues that it is convenient to be able to swap in, like PriorityQueues. They fulfill the same interface but behave differently. I don't think there is anything like that for Stacks, or at least it isn't used nearly as often.
