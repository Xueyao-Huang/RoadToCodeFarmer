# A general approach to level order traversal

There are many questions that can be solved by level order traversal. We can use both BFS and DFS.

Let's first see the two templates of BFS and DFS.

1. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

2. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II


3. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal


4. Average of Levels in Binary Tree


5. Binary Tree Right Side View


6. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row


7. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
