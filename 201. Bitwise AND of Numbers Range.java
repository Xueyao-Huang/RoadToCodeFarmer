/*
The hardest part of this problem is to find the regular pattern.
For example, for number 26 to 30
Their binary form are:
11010
11011
11100ã€€ã€€
11101ã€€ã€€
11110

Because we are trying to find bitwise AND, so if any bit there are at least one 0 and one 1, it always 0. In this case, it is 11000.
So we are go to cut all these bit that they are different. In this case we cut the right 3 bit.

class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
	// i means we have how many bits are 0 on the right
        int i = 0;
        while (m != n) {
            m >>= 1;
            n >>= 1;
            i++;
        }
        return m << i;
    }
}

/*
The trick here is that :
Bitwise-AND of any two numbers will always produce a number less than or equal to the smaller number.

Consider the following example:

									12 ---- 1100
									11 ---- 1011
									10 ---- 1010
									9  ---- 1001
									8  ---- 1000
									7  ---- 0111
									6  ---- 0110
									5  ---- 0101

Desired Range: [5,12]

Starting from 12, the loop will first do
12 & 11 = 8

Next iteration, the loop will do
8 & 7 = 0

why did we skip anding of 10,9? Because even if we did so, the result would eventually be anded with 8 whose value would be lesser than equal to 8.

Hence, you start from the range end and keep working your way down the range till you reach the start.
